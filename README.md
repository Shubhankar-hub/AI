## Introduction
The goal of this repository is to provide simple and clean implementations of various AI algorithms. These include classical search techniques and game-solving strategies that are widely used in AI courses and practical applications.

## Algorithms

### 1. **Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)**
   - **Description**: GBFS is a search algorithm that expands the node that appears to be closest to the goal. It uses a heuristic to guide the search.
   - **Usage**: Useful for problems where a heuristic can effectively estimate the goal.

### 2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
   - **Description**: BFS is an uninformed search algorithm that explores all the nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
   - **Usage**: Ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

### 3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
   - **Description**: DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, making it suitable for exploring deeper solutions.
   - **Usage**: Often used in scenarios where the solution is deep in the search tree.

### 4. **Heuristic 8-Puzzle**
   - **Description**: This implementation of the 8-puzzle problem uses heuristics such as the Manhattan distance to guide the search.
   - **Usage**: A classic example of a heuristic search problem, useful for studying optimization techniques.

### 5. **Tic Tac Toe (Minimax Algorithm)**
   - **Description**: A simple implementation of Tic Tac Toe using the Minimax algorithm to simulate an AI opponent that plays optimally.
   - **Usage**: A basic AI game-solving strategy, showcasing adversarial search.
